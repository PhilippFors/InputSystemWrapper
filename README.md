# InputSystemWrapper
This is a class which wraps an Input Action of the new Unity Input System. It adds some extra useful functionality.

To use this class, simply initialize it with an input action asset by using the constructor. The class will be ready to use from that point on. You can add additional identification, such as a string for naming the input if you so desire.
